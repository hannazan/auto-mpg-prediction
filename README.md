# Auto MPG Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict vehicle fuel efficiency (Miles Per Gallon - MPG) based on various vehicle characteristics. The project covers the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Project Overview

Fuel efficiency is an important aspect of vehicle performance. This project aims to predict a car's fuel efficiency (MPG) using technical specifications such as engine size, horsepower, vehicle weight, acceleration, production year, and country of origin.

### Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| R² Score | **0.79** |
| RMSE | **3.26** |

## Key Findings

- Vehicle weight has a strong negative relationship with fuel efficiency.
- Higher horsepower generally leads to lower MPG.
- Newer vehicles tend to have better fuel efficiency.
- Country of origin also influences fuel efficiency.
- The Linear Regression model explains approximately **79%** of the variation in MPG.

---

## Feature Engineering

The following preprocessing steps were performed before model training:

- Removed missing values.
- Dropped the `name` column.
- Applied One-Hot Encoding to the `origin` feature.
- Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
